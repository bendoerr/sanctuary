Sanctuary Development Tools Readme

-- Create a shortcut to go.bat, or run it directly to get a
   functional Development shell with access to all the tools.
   
-- As tools are needed install them into the tools directory
   following the convention toolname-version.
   
-- Sanctuary is preconfigured for a handful of tools. Additional
   configuration can be achieved though developer specific configs.
   
-- Do not maintain Git within Sanctuary. Git will not be happy.
